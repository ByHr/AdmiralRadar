\subsection*{35. As a developer, I would like to be able to communicate between server and client}

\samtable[User Story 35]{US_35}

\subsubsection*{Acceptance Criteria:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Given that there are multiple clients running, when they send commands or messages to the server, the server should be capable of handling and responding to all of them.
\item Given that a command is received from the client, the server should be able to accept and properly interpret the command.
\item Server should be able to notify clients about the constantly updating game objects.
\end{itemize}
