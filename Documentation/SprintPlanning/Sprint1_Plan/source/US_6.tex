\subsection*{6. As a user, I would like to be able to play on a turn based mode}

\samtable[User Story 6]{US_6}

\subsubsection*{Acceptance Criteria:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The first user to join the lobby determines the upcoming game?s mode.
\item Given that the game is in turn-based mode, when it is not a user?s current turn, the user?s team should be unable to perform another turn immediately.
\item Given that the game is in turn-based mode, appropriate game logic must be applied to the start of various player roles (such as mine detonation, etc.)
\end{itemize}
