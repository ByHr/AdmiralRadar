\subsection*{34. As a developer, I would like to be able to store game information in server}

\samtable[User Story 34]{US_34}

\subsubsection*{Acceptance Criteria:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Given a current game, the server will assign the proper GUI to the client.
\item Given a current game, the server will correctly indicate if the next location requested will result in a collision (with an island, mine, border, etc.).
\item Given a current game, the server will correctly keep track of what the current game state is.
\end{itemize}
