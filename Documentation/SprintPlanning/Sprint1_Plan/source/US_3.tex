\subsection*{3. As a user, I would like to be able to start, join, and end a game when I like}

\samtable[User Story 3]{US_3}

\subsubsection*{Acceptance Criteria:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Given a player on a team leaves mid-game, that server will automatically force the team to forfeit the game.
\item Given a player starts a game in the lobby, when other players login and arrive in the lobby, they should be able to see that game and have the option to join it.
\item Given a game has less players than the minimum required, when a player attempts to start the game, they should be shown error message and the game should not start.
\end{itemize}
