\subsection*{43. As a Developer, I would like each player's client to be distinct and separate. No player role should be able to perform actions of other team members for them.

\samtable[User Story 43]{US_43}

\subsubsection*{Acceptance Criteria:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Given that the player has a certain role (e.g. Captain), when he/she interacts with the GUI, they should only be presented with the actions related to his/her specific role.
\item Clients should not be able to send nor receive peer-to-peer communication.
\item If an action is currently being performed by another player, the other players must wait until the end of turn before performing another action.
\end{itemize}
