The user client forms a many-to-one relationship to the game server. In our project, the server handles most of the calculations and stores the data for the actual game. The clients are relatively thin, handling graphical displays of game data, playing audio, and sending commands issued by the player to the server. The server executes these commands, such as moving a ship or firing a torpedo, and then updates the game variables, sending updated info to the appropriate clients based on game rules. In the case of  actions that require multiple team member inputs, such as issuing a move command, the server will wait for all appropriate commands from every necessary client before executing the command. Also, the client will wait for the server to notify them that other team members have finished before allowing further actions.
