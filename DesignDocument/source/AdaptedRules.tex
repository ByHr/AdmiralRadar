While \textit{Admiral Radar} will have nearly the same gameplay as \textit{Captain Sonar}, two important sets of changes must be made in order to fully make the rules we've described applicable. First, we'll be retheming the game around spacecraft in orbit, rather than submarines. On account of this change, certain mechanisms have been renamed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Torpedos are now Missiles
\item Sonar is now Radar
\item Silencing is now Boosting
\item Surfacing is now going on a Spacewalk
\item Islands are now Asteroids
\item The atomic reactors are now solar panels.
\end{itemize}

In addition, Admiral Radar will add an additional gameplay element: more than two Submarines. To support this, the Radio Officer will keep track of multiple tracks, and the Sonar and Drone mechanisms will report information from all enemy vessels simulationousky.
