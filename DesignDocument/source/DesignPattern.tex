We decided to implement a client-server model for our project. Since our project is a game that allows many users to play together and requires coordination between team members, we thought that this design pattern was appropriate. Each instance of the server handles a single game of Admiral Radar and connects to multiple clients, one for each user. Also,  when a player logs in to their account the server will access a database for authentication.

1.	Desktop Client
a. Each player will have their own client, with changes in GUI based on player role.
b. Clients send player actions to, and receive information about the states of the game, from the Server.
c. Clients update GUI based on game data received from the server.

2.	Game Server
a. Performs the majority of calculations required for the game.
b. Accepts requests for information and commands from the clients, and performs the appropriate action.
c. Queries Login Database for user authentication info.
d. Stores all information related to game state. (Position and Health of ships, Location of Mines etc.)

3.	Login Database
a. Contain User Data for each account. Data includes Username, Avatar, Past Game Statistics.
