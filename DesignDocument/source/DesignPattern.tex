We decided to implement a client-server model for our project. Since our project is a game that allows many users to play together and requires coordination between team members, we thought that this design pattern was appropriate. Each instance of the server handles a single game of Admiral Radar and connects to multiple clients, one for each user. Also,  when a player logs in to their account the server will access a database for authentication.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Desktop Client
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each player will have their own client, with changes in GUI based on player role.
\item Clients send player actions to, and receive information about the states of the game, from the Server.
\item Clients update GUI based on game data received from the server.
\end{enumerate}

\item Game Server
\begin{enumerate}
\item Performs the majority of calculations required for the game.
\item Accepts requests for information and commands from the clients, and performs the appropriate action.
\item Queries Login Database for user authentication info.
\item Stores all information related to game state. (Position and Health of ships, Location of Mines etc.)
\end{enumerate}

\item Login Database
\begin{enumerate}
\item Contain User Data for each account. Data includes Username, Password, Avatar, Past Game Statistics.
\item Provide authentication for user connections.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
