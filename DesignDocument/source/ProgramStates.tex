The client's initial state when it is first opened displays a login GUI. From there the player can enter credentials to attempt to login. If incorrect login information is given, the program remains in this state. If the login is successful, the program continues to a the "Select Game" state where it allows players to select which game they want to join. After successfully joining a game, the program moves to the "Choose Role" state where it displays player roles and allows for each player to select their role. Finally the program goes into the "Game Running" state, interacting with the player, sending commands, and responding to server messages, until the game ends. When the game ends, the program goes back to the "Select Game" state, allowing the player to start another game. The player can quit during the "Login" and "Select Game" states, which will end the program.
