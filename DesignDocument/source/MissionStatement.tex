Board games are a lost art, and part of a treasured history. By adapting the popular board game Captain Sonar, we attempt to digitize the game and open it to a wider audience through online play, more intuitive gameplay, and additional functionalities not possible on a physical board. Admiral Radar: Space Expedition allows players to enjoy the gameplay mechanics originally found in Captain Sonar but without the need for players to be in the same geographic location. Some game features are simply not even possible in physical board games such as team-only communication, persistent player statistics, or single player gameplay, demonstrating the need for board games such as Captain Sonar to be brought into the digital space.
