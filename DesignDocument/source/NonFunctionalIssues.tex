\subsubsection*{Issue: \textit{How will a team play with fewer than four members?}}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item An AI would take control of the slots lacking players.
    \item \textbf{Allow a user to occupy multiple spots.}
  \end{itemize}

This is a very simple fix and potentially the most fun for players. The challenge of having fewer people control a ship creates real tension and greater reward should this team pull off a victory against the odds. Of course, we will look into developing an AI at some point in the future which would allow the players to decide either option as they wish.

    \item The users would have to each move at the same time with the arrow keys.
  \end{itemize}
