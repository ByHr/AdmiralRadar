Any member?s absence ? Any team member?s absence must be thoroughly communicated to the team as soon as the member is aware of his or her forthcoming absence, along with any reasoning pertaining to the absence. Repeated absences of a team member without proper rationale will result in the member?s workload re-distributed among the team and the member reported to the course instructor. 

Absence of a vital (skillset) member ? In the absence of a member who?s skillset is vital for the current task at hand, the remaining team will delegate a team member to learn the necessary skillsets of the vital team member until his or her return.

Member?s absent for <1 week ? Any member who is absent for 7 days or less due to an urgent matter is still held responsible for the accumulated workload of the missed week. The accumulated workload is expected to be completed within a similar time frame to that of the team member?s absence.

Member?s absent for >1 week ? Any member who is absent more than 7 days for an urgent matter will have his position on the team forfeited and workload re-distributed among remaining team members. The leaving member is responsible for transferring any required skillsets to the new members responsible for the leaving member?s tasks.
